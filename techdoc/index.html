                <article>
                    <p>In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit of the University of
                        Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, released NCSA Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser,
                        which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the
                        NeXTSTEP niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years earlier. In 1994, a company called
                        Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California and employed many of the
                        original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no
                        code with NCSA Mosaic. The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood
                        for "Mosaic killer", as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world's number
                        one web browser. The first version of the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in
                        late 1994. Within four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market and
                        became the main web browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA,
                        the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and the company took
                        the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to
                        become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the founder of the company believed that HTML needed a
                        "glue language" that was easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble
                        components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the Web page
                        markup.</p>
                    <p>In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of embedding the Scheme
                        programming language into its Netscape Navigator.[14] Before he could get started, Netscape
                        Communications collaborated with Sun Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more
                        static programming language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web
                        technologies and platforms.[15] Netscape Communications then decided that the scripting
                        language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have a similar syntax, which
                        excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend the idea of
                        JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10
                        days, in May 1995.</p>
                    <p>Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript
                        when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was
                        renamed JavaScript[2] when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in
                        December.[16] The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the
                        language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been
                        characterized[17] as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was
                        then the hot new Web programming language.</p>
                    <p>There is a common misconception that JavaScript was influenced by an earlier Web page scripting
                        language developed by Nombas named Cmm (not to be confused with the later C-- created in
                        1997).[18][19] Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of Cmm before he created LiveScript.[20]
                        Nombas did pitch their embedded Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting was
                        not a new concept, as shown by the ViolaWWW Web browser.[21] Nombas later switched to offering
                        JavaScript instead of Cmm in their ScriptEase product and was part of the TC39 group that
                        standardized ECMAScript.</p>

                    <p>In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an
                        implementation of the language for server-side scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server.[23]</p>
                    <p>Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of server-side
                        Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.[24]</p>
                    <p>Since the mid-2000s, additional server-side JavaScript implementations have been introduced,
                        such as Node.js in 2009.[25]</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Microsoft script technologies including VBScript and JScript were released in 1996. JScript, a
                        reverse-engineered implementation of Netscape's JavaScript, was part of Internet Explorer 3.
                        JScript was also available for server-side scripting in Internet Information Server. Internet
                        Explorer 3 also included Microsoft's first support for CSS and various extensions to HTML, but
                        in each case the implementation was noticeably different from that found in Netscape Navigator
                        at the time.[26][27] These differences made it difficult for designers and programmers to make
                        a single website work well in both browsers, leading to the use of "best viewed in Netscape"
                        and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos that characterized these early years of the
                        browser wars.[28] JavaScript began to acquire a reputation for being one of the roadblocks to a
                        cross-platform and standards-driven Web. Some developers took on the difficult task of trying
                        to make their sites work in both major browsers, but many could not afford the time.[26] With
                        the release of Internet Explorer 4, Microsoft introduced the concept of Dynamic HTML, but the
                        differences in language implementations and the different and proprietary Document Object
                        Models remained and were obstacles to widespread take-up of JavaScript on the Web.</p>

                <header>Standardization
                </header>
                <article>
                    <p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International to carve out a standard
                        specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at
                        Netscape. This led to the official release of the language specification ECMAScript published
                        in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard in June 1997, with JavaScript being the most well
                        known of the implementations. ActionScript and JScript were other well-known implementations of
                        ECMAScript.

                        The release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 continued the standards process cycle, conforming some
                        modifications to the ISO/IEC 16262 international standard. ECMAScript 3 was released in
                        December 1999 and is the modern-day baseline for JavaScript. The original ECMAScript 4 work led
                        by Waldemar Horwat (then at Netscape, now at Google) started in 2000. Microsoft initially
                        participated and implemented some proposals in their JScript .NET language.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over time it was clear that Microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper
                        JavaScript in Internet Explorer, even though they had no competing proposal and they had a
                        partial (and diverged at this point) implementation on the .NET server side. So by 2003, the
                        original ECMAScript 4 work was mothballed.

                        The next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in JavaScript's history. First,
                        Brendan Eich and Mozilla rejoined Ecma International as a not-for-profit member and work
                        started on ECMAScript for XML (E4X), the ECMA-357 standard, which came from ex-Microsoft
                        employees at BEA Systems (originally acquired as Crossgain). This led to working jointly with
                        Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in ActionScript 3
                        (ActionScript 3 was a fork of original ECMAScript 4).</p>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                        }
                        greetMe("World");</code>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                        }
                        greetMe("World");</code>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                        }
                        greetMe("World");</code>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                        }
                        greetMe("World");</code>
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                        }
                        greetMe("World");</code>

                    <p>So, along with Macromedia, work restarted on ECMAScript 4 with the goal of standardizing what
                        was in ActionScript 3. To this end, Adobe Systems released the ActionScript Virtual Machine 2,
                        code named Tamarin, as an open source project. But Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too
                        different from web JavaScript to converge, as was realized by the parties in 2007 and 2008.

                        Alas, there was still turmoil between the various players; Douglas Crockford—then at
                        Yahoo!—joined forces with Microsoft in 2007 to oppose ECMAScript 4, which led to the ECMAScript
                        3.1 effort. The development of ECMAScript 4 was never completed, but that work influenced
                        subsequent versions.[29]

                    <p>JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the Web. However, many
                        professional programmers initially denigrated the language due to the perceived target audience
                        of Web authors and other such "amateurs".[30] The advent of Ajax returned JavaScript to the
                        spotlight and brought more professional programming attention. The result was a proliferation
                        of comprehensive frameworks and libraries, improved JavaScript programming practices, and
                        increased usage of JavaScript outside Web browsers, as seen by the proliferation of Server-side
                        JavaScript platforms.</p>
                    <p>In January 2009, the CommonJS project was founded with the goal of specifying a common standard
                        library mainly for JavaScript development outside the browser.[31]
                        <ul>
                            <li>item 1</li>
                            <li>item 2</li>
                            <li>item 3</li>
                            <li>item 4</li>
                            <li>item 5</li>
                        </ul>
                        With the rise of single-page applications and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being
                        used as a compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static
                        languages.</p>
